# Cost-Structure
This is one of the notable projects that I completed during my internship at WinCommerce. The project aimed to collect the components and ingredients that would be included in a mooncake set, from which the base price could be calculated to propose and negotiate with suppliers.

## Material List 
The Material List section will include the purchase price, tax, and detailed description of the components, from: the tin box, tea, the mooncakes,....

## Cost structure 
The Cost Structure section will be based on the unit price of the components and the FM (Fixed Margin) target to calculate the final selling price in the market. This result can then be used as the base price for negotiation and discussion with suppliers.
